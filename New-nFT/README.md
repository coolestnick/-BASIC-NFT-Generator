# Sample Hardhat Project

Using hardhat deployed a NFT on Goerli TEST-NETWORK and the address generated after deploying the smart contract on Goerli-test NETWORK we can check that address on "https://testnets.opensea.io/".

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
